DHlibxls - An ObjectiveC Framework that can read MicroSoft Excel(TM) Files.

This Framework is based on the libxls open source project host on sourceforge.net:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libxls/
  
Usage: include the enclosed project in your primary Xcode project. Insure that there is a dependency
  on it in an Target that uses it. [It does not use categories so no need for "-forceload".]

Building: the github repository does not include the libxls source - the Xcode project downloads it 
  when you run your first build. From then on, every build does an "svn update" in the source to 
  insure it's up-to-date.
   
Run the Test project to see the framework in action (and how to wire it up).

To get step by step instructions on how to include DHxlsReaderIOS.xcodeproj into your Xcode project, see:
